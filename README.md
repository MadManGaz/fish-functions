# Fish Functions 🐠

These functions are suitable for a Mac computer, and contain aliases for git,
useful functions for using Rosetta 2 on an M1 Mac, functions that interface
with other command line utilities like sdkman, and others that I find useful.
There is currently no way to automatically install dependencies for these fish
functions, will maybe add later.
