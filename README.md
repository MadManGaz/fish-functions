# Fish Functions üê†

These are my functions that I use for fish. Some of this requires dependencies,
but I haven't got those listed here. This is really for my own use, but thought
it may as well be public.

## Notes

- You are required to install `exa`, as the ls.fish script replaces this with the rust written `exa` tool.
- If you want to make use of the `rcat` command, you will need to install `bat`, which is a colorized replacement of cat.
