# Fish Functions 🐠

These are my personal fish functions. They are specific to an M1 mac mini and
contain convenience functions for things like git, and running things in
rosetta. I can't remember what exactly is in here, but rest assured, some of
this stuff relies on software that isn't there on a fresh system.
