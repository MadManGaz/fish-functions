# Fish Functions 🐠

These are my functions that I use for fish. Some of this requires dependencies,
but I haven't got those listed here. This is really for my own use, but thought
it may as well be public.

## Notes

- Please run `install_rust_utils` right after cloning or things like ls won't work.
